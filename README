=== Installation ===
1. Place this application into a directory where cgi-scripts are evaluated.
2. If you want to change some configuration, state it in the file »config.rb«
   (see config_sample.rb for help)
   to start with a default configuration.
3. The webserver needs the permission to write into the directory 
4. You have to build a .mo file from the .po file in order to use the 
   localization. Type:
      make
   This requires libgettext-ruby-util, potool, and make to be installed.
     sudo aptitude install libgettext-ruby-util potool make
   If this does not work for you, you can download the .mo files from another
   server, e.g., put https://dudle.inf.tu-dresden.de/locale/de/dudle.mo
   into the directory locale/de.
5. In order to let access control work correctly, the webserver needs 
   auth_digest support. It therefore may help to type:
     sudo a2enmod auth_digest
6. In order to get atom-feed support you need ruby-ratom to be installed. E.g.:
     sudo aptitude install rubygems ruby-dev libxml2-dev zlib1g-dev
     sudo gem install ratom

=== Pimp your Installation ===
 * If you want to create your own Stylesheet, you just have to put it in
   the folder »$DUDLE_HOME_FOLDER/css/«. Afterwards you may config this one
   to be the default Stylesheet. Examples can be found here:
     https://dudle.inf.tu-dresden.de/css/
   This is a bazaar repository as well, so you may branch it if you want…
     cd $DUDLE_HOME_FOLDER/css
     bzr branch https://dudle.inf.tu-dresden.de/css/ .
   Send me your Stylesheet if you want it to appear at 
   https://dudle.inf.tu-dresden.de
 * If you want to extend the functionality you might want to place a file
   »main.rb« in $DUDLE_HOME_FOLDER/extension/$YOUR_EXTENSION/main.rb
   Examples can be found here:
     https://dudle.inf.tu-dresden.de/unstable/extensions/
     which again are repositories ;--) e.g.:
     cd $DUDLE_HOME_FOLDER/dudle/extensions/
     bzr branch https://dudle.inf.tu-dresden.de/unstable/extensions/10_participate/
     bzr branch https://dudle.inf.tu-dresden.de/unstable/extensions/symcrypt/

=== Translators ===
If you set $DUDLE_POEDIT_AUTO to your lang, poedit will launch automatically when building the application.
E.g.:
	export DUDLE_POEDIT_AUTO=fr
	bzr pull
	make # will launch poedit if new french strings are to be translated
